# Rice_Export_Analysis


### **Problem Statement :**
  The comprehensive dataset contains detailed information about rice exports from various exporters
from all over the world. The dataset encompasses essential attributes such as importer/exporter
names, addresses, quantities, values, and other pertinent details. Goal is to conduct an extensive data
analysis to extract meaningful insights and address key questions regarding the rice export
transactions. 


### Libraries/Modules needed for the project!
- Plotly, Seaborn - (To plot and visualize the data)
- Pandas - (To Clean and maipulate the data)
- Streamlit - (To Create Graphical user Interface)

### Workflow :

#### Step 1 :
   Load the Rice_Export dataset through pandas library.
#### Step 2 : 
  Clean the  Rice_Export dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency and stored the dataframe as a new .csv file.
#### Step 3 :
  Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Rice_Export dataset to create interactive plot.
#### Step 4 :
  Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize which impoters and exporters done the most importing and exporting with the help of variables like year and import value of FOB.
